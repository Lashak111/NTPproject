          <h2>IT Audit</h2>
          <p>
            <span> When was your last company check-up? </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Businesses are relying on their IT department now more than ever.
            Supporting and maintaining a functional and secure IT environment
            was already taking up the time of IT departments across the world
            before a wave of new devices, operating systems and a whole lot of
            new issues entered the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a stable and efficient network is very important for business
            nowadays. That’s a well-known fact. But supporting and maintaining
            such a network is very often difficult. If network problems occur,
            fast and efficient reaction is crucial. Business owners and managers
            know that they can get better productivity from their staff if their
            IT is designed to deliver productivity and more importantly minimise
            downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many may not even know there is a better way. This is where IT
            auditing comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Why Is IT Auditing Necessary?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            IT auditing is primarily of several types – performance, compliance
            to applicable laws, standards and policies, and financial statement
            audits. The main objective of the audits is to see whether there are
            any inaccuracies and inefficiencies in the management and use of the
            IT system of a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system first identifies the risks in an entity and then
            assesses them with the help of advanced design controls, therefore
            allowing the companies to think of an appropriate solution to tackle
            the threats. Thus, IT auditing is critical for companies and
            businesses looking to protect their IT systems and valuable data and
            information.
          </p>
          <p><span>What is involved in an IT audit?</span></p>
          <p>
            IT auditing is undertaken for a number of reasons, often relating to
            performance, compliance, cost and security. During the auditing
            process, an IT specialist will assess a company’s infrastructure,
            policies and information. There are generally a number of different
            steps that will often vary depending on the nature and the needs of
            the business. Some of these include:
          </p>

          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Risk assessments for the many aspects of a company’s IT department
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Identifying technology-related risks in an organisation, and

            ⇨ Assessing a business's readiness for new and upcoming technology

            reliable and effective.
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ This will also often include evaluation of the use of these
            systems and applications.
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the technology itself
            and the current use by employees.

          <p><span>How Can IT Consulting Services Help Your Business?</span></p>
          <p>
            As businesses rely on information technologies and IT consulting to
            keep pace with today’s fast-moving IT landscape. Failing to react
            quickly and accurately, you risk being outpaced by your competitors
            who are using technology to their advantage!
          </p>
          <p>
            Successful organizations look ahead, identify where they need to be,
            and map out the technology that will get them there. For many
            organizations, IT consultants are a big part of that roadmap.
          </p>

          <p><span>Benefits of IT Consultant Services</span></p>
          <p>
            IT consultants give you access to a wealth of specialized talent,
            proven best practices, and winning processes, all based on thousands
            of hours of experience with many customers. The benefits of an IT
            consultant can include:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Expertise: </span> In many small and mid-sized companies,
            in-house IT staff are generalists. With an external IT consultant,
            however, you can gain specialized skills, in-depth knowledge of
            current solutions, and the tools and capabilities your organization
            requires.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Faster project completion: </span> Many consultants engage
            quickly and require minimal time to get up to speed. They also work
            quickly, as they bring the right experience and tools to every
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Potential cost savings: </span> An IT specialist can often
            complete technology projects using fewer resources than your
            in-house might need. The consultant will give you an accurate
            upfront estimate regarding the cost of the engagement, and once the
            project is complete, you won’t need to keep the specialist on the
            payroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Skills transfer: </span> A consultant can share expertise and
            provide training throughout the engagement, resulting in a stronger
            in-house team overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Reduced security risk: </span> IT consultants can identify and
            resolve security threats in your network and systems. They work with
            your team to establish processes and protocols to ensure better
            ongoing protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Increased productivity: </span> In-house IT teams, especially
            in smaller companies, are often overwhelmed with multiple projects
            and conflicting priorities. Engaging an IT consultant to complete
            specific projects can free up your team to focus on core business
            functions and priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Improved processes: </span> IT consultants deliver more than
            just technical expertise. They also use proven, repeatable processes
            that they pass on to your team through documented IT playbooks and
            technology training.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> An objective view: </span>Armed with experience and a toolkit
            of best practices, IT consultants bring a fresh perspective to your
            technology environment. They identify issues you may have overlooked
            and make recommendations about improving or replacing legacy
            technology systems and practices.

              Why Your Business Need Information Technology Planning Services?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most significant reason, the key point and the value
            delivered by IT planning is that you can create an IT strategic plan
            or roadmap for your organization. In general, an IT strategic plan
            lays out your key business drivers, objectives and goals, and
            identifies the actions needed to achieve them.
          </p>
          <p>
            An IT roadmap is crucial to ensure your technology organization is
            in alignment with the overall business strategy and objectives.
            Having a documented IT strategy benefits both technology leaders and
            functional executives by creating transparency and encouraging
            collaboration across teams.

          <h2>Support & Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Given the 24x7x365 nature of today’s business, uptime and
            availability of critical resources play an important role in
            determining the success of an organization. To ensure business
            continuity, organizations must overcome unique challenges every day.
            One of these challenges is downtime
          </p>
          <p>
            Downtime is disruptive, costly and unacceptable in today’s
            competitive business landscape. Downtime can happen for several
            reasons, ranging from accidental data deletion to application
            failure to advanced cyberattacks. Without a robust BCDR solution in
            place, a downtime event can result in costly consequences and
            tarnish your brand’s reputation.
          </p>
          <p><span> What Does Downtime Mean in Business? </span></p>
          <p>
            Downtime is a period during which production or business processes
            come to a halt due to application unavailability, technical glitch,
            network outage or natural disaster. During downtime, a computer
            system, server or network is offline or unavailable, and employees
            are involuntarily unproductive — unable to conduct business or
            service clients. Without a comprehensive business continuity plan,
            downtime can potentially paralyze your organization, and in some
            cases, even cause irreparable damage.
          </p>
          <p><span> Types of Downtime </span></p>
          <p>
            <span
              >Downtime can be broadly classified into planned downtime and
              unplanned downtime.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p><span>Planned Downtime </span></p>
          <p>This is where NTP maintenance service comes into play.</p>
          <p>
            Planned downtime is scheduled and anticipated in advance and may
            typically be carried out during holidays, weekends or after working
            hours. This ensures normal business operations are uninterrupted and
            employee productivity is unaffected. Planned downtime can be for
            routine maintenance or inspection, hardware/software upgrades,
            repairs or testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since planned downtime is intentional and controlled, it doesn’t
            have any negative impact on business when done right. Planned
            downtime is essential to ensure systems, applications and servers
            are up to date and are functioning at optimal capacity. During
            planned downtime, IT professionals can also run tests to identify
            potential threats and fix them before they turn into real problems.
          </p>
          <p><span>What Are IT Maintenance Services? </span></p>
          <p>
            IT maintenance services is a blanket term that includes complete
            software and hardware maintenance support for your business computer
            system. That means making a complete record of all hardware and
            software that must be maintained for the system to function properly
            and optimally and taking the responsibility of making sure to
            perform any maintenance tasks the system requires to meet that goal.
          </p>
          <p><span>Why Do I Need IT Maintenance Services? </span></p>
          <p>
            Keeping a whole business’ IT system — both software and hardware —
            running smoothly is a big task, even if you are a relatively small
            company. If you run a larger company, it can seem completely
            overwhelming. One solution, of course, is to hire in-house IT staff.
            However, this can become extremely expensive, especially in larger
            companies, and even an IT staff can become overwhelmed if enough
            issues arrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you hire a dedicated IT maintenance support company like NTP to
            handle your software and hardware maintenance, you shift the
            enormous burden of making sure your IT is working properly off your
            plate and onto ours, so you can concentrate on the performance of
            your current business. You don’t have to concern yourself about what
            might go wrong with your IT system because you will know we are
            monitoring everything and will take care of any problems as they
            arise if any should occur, but if you are looking for instant help

          <p><span> Unplanned Downtime </span></p>
          <p>
            Unplanned downtime, on the other hand, is unintentional,
            unanticipated and can occur at any time. This can be due to several
            reasons, including hardware or software failure, human error,
            malicious attacks or natural disasters. Since unplanned downtime is
            unexpected and occurs without a warning, preventing it can be a
            challenge. Regardless of its causes, unplanned downtime can bring
            your business to a grinding halt. However, by implementing a
            well-established business continuity plan, you can minimize the
            impact of downtime to a large extent.
          </p>
          <p><span>What Are the Causes of Downtime? </span></p>
          <p>
            There are several causes of downtime. Some of the main causes are
            explained below:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Human Error: </span> Regardless of whether accidental or due
            to negligence, human error is one of the most common causes of
            unplanned downtime. An employee unintentionally deleting data or
            accidentally unplugging a cable or not following standard protocols
            can lead to costly downtime. Human error is unavoidable but with
            regular training and having a well-documented IT checklist or
            policies, its frequency can be reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Hardware/Software Failure: </span> Obsolete hardware or
            software increases the chances of application failure and system
            outage. Outdated hardware and software also result in inefficient
            performance, which can have a significant impact on productivity. If
            patches are applied without proper testing, it can corrupt the
            entire application.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Device Misconfiguration: </span>Device misconfiguration is
            another major cause of unplanned downtime. Configuration errors can
            create security gaps in your network, making it vulnerable to
            cyberattacks. To avoid misconfiguration errors, you can automate the
            process instead of setting the parameters manually. Test the
            configurations in a lab setting before implementing the changes to
            your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Bugs: </span> Bugs in a server’s operating system can impact
            its performance as well as lead to security issues. If patches
            aren’t applied on time or applied without appropriate testing, it
            can corrupt applications and lead to server failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Cybersecurity Threats: </span> Cyberthreats, including
            sophisticated ransomware and phishing attacks, are one of the most
            dangerous and common causes of IT downtime, and can bring your
            organization to a standstill. Malicious actors can easily exploit
            vulnerabilities in your network, infiltrate systems and gain access
            to confidential data. Employee training and implementing security
            solutions, such as spam filters, multifactor authentication and file
            encryption, can go a long way towards overcoming cybersecurity
            challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Natural Disasters: </span>Natural disasters, such as
            hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, can disrupt power supply and
            communication or even damage hardware. This can have catastrophic
            consequences on your business if downtime extends for a prolonged
            period.
          </p>
          <p>Downtime Costs</p>
          <p>
            Downtime costs can vary depending on the size and nature of your
            business as well as the duration of downtime.

            unproductive period depends on the duration of the downtime.

          <p>
            <span>Lost Business Opportunities: </span> In today’s interconnected
            digital world where businesses rely heavily on application uptime
            and availability, a moment of downtime can leave a negative impact
            on your business. Downtime can result in bad experiences, like your
            customers being unable to access your products or services while
            your employees are unable to support them since the necessary tools
            are out of order. Such instances can easily drive away existing
            clients as well as prospects.

          <p>
            <span>Damaged Brand Image: </span>In this fast-paced business
            landscape, customers expect a quick, seamless experience every time.
            Delays are intolerable and downtime is unacceptable. In such a
            scenario, a single downtime event can put your organization’s
            reliability and reputation at risk. Repeated downtime events can
            result in unhappy customers, which can quickly translate into bad
            customer reviews and tarnished brand image.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Data Loss: </span> Downtime affects not only your business but
            your clients as well. Downtime due to cyberattacks, server or
            network outage can result in corrupt, damaged or stolen data.
            Unexpected downtime, such as a server outage, can potentially expose
            your valuable data or create security gaps, which cybercriminals can
            exploit to gain unauthorized access.
          </p>
          <p><span> Downtime Monitoring and Prevention</span></p>
          <p>
            It is unpredictable and can happen to any organization, irrespective
            of its size. In the process of planning any solution, we always
            develop disaster recovery plans and implement BCDR (Business
            continuity and disaster recovery) to minimise downtime impact on
            business.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if you don’t have BCDR, you are already in the process of
            updating your existing infrastructure, network and applications or
            not yet aware of what you should do or how you can maximise
            prevention?
          </p>
          <p>
            You might know how to work with your company’s systems, but you will
            need our maintenance services that can reduce downtime risks, so
            that you can ensure your devices are up to date, test backups
            regularly, constantly monitor your network and devices, but still,
            if you don’t have yet implemented proper BCDR there is a possibility
            for the unexpected downtime and so if something goes badly wrong do
            you know what to do? How can you keep your finger on the pulse 24x7?
            How long can you afford to be without your systems before it starts
            to affect your customers and therefore your business?

          <p>
            NTP IT Support team's role is to make sure, in case of human error,
            your data is not deleted and, in case of attack, is stored in a
            secure environment and make sure it is easily accessible but only to
            the people that are allowed to view it. Without the support of a
            professional IT team, you could end up storing data in a vulnerable
            location. Or giving access to somebody without the right permission.
            This can be a big issue where data protection is concerned. In case
            of application, hardware or software failure, natural disaster or
            security misconfiguration, fix the issue asap so that your business
            will continue to operate without failure.

          <p><span>What Is IT Outsourcing? </span></p>
          <p>
            IT outsourcing is the use of external service providers to
            effectively deliver IT-enabled business process, application service
            and infrastructure solutions for business outcomes.
          </p>
          <p><span>Why Companies Oursource </span></p>
          <p>
            One of the reasons why companies outsource their IT tasks is to get
            access to additional IT specialists with the experience and
            expertise needed. Finding them can be a challenging task for most
            businesses. The demand for new specialists experienced in
            complicated technology is considerably increased in our country. As
            the demand is higher than the supply, the available specialists
            increased their labour/service prices significantly too.
          </p>
          <p><span>Covid-19 Impact </span></p>
          <p>
            Covid-19 is an event that changed a lot of lives and businesses. It
            has influenced the outsourcing sphere and brought new IT outsourcing
            trends. Due to, Covid-19 in 2020, many businesses have started to
            use remote work.
          </p>
          <p><span>IT budgets </span></p>
          <p>
            Even before Covid-19, constant spending growth on outsourcing IT
            services was observed as well, but the global pandemic led to rapid
            increases and cost saving became one of the major factors in
            outsourcing.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Deloitte, 70% of businesses turned to an outsourcing
            partner for cost reduction in 2020. And Outsource Accelerator
            suggests that labor costs themselves can be reduced by at least 70%.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, cost isn’t the only factor. 49% of companies state that
            freeing up resources to focus on core tasks is one of the leading
            factors supporting outsourcing.
          </p>
          <p><span>Benefits of IT Outsourcing </span></p>
          <p>
            There are many proven strong sides of IT outsourcing that our
            partner companies can benefit from. Here are just some of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Cost Advantages It is one of the most obvious benefits that
            outsourcing may bring. Business is done for making money and the
            less operational costs are, the more companies will be able to
            invest in its future development.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Costs are saved thanks to the optimization of the following
              things.
            </span>
          </p>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Hourly rates</h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Equipment & infrastructure</h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Recruitment and hiring costs</h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Training</h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Taxes</h5>
          <p>
            2. Increased Efficiency & Innovation Outsourcing brings new
            additional resources into the project which results in faster work
            and, thanks to the introduction of effective practices and skills,
            increased efficiency of the team. In fact, it has become the main
            reason for outsourcing, which is now called disruptive outsourcing.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Access to Skilled Resources & Staffing Flexibility As was
            mentioned and proved, the demand for skilled IT specialists will
            grow. Fast. IT outsourcing is an option to get access to trained and
            experienced staff the moment the business needs them (especially for
            companies that have seasonal or cyclical demands).
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Internal Staff Education One of the reasons for using our NTP's
            outsource staff might be that the in-house team doesn’t have the
            required knowledge and/or skills. Outsourcing (especially on-site)
            may result in improving in-house team qualification thanks to
            knowledge sharing and mentoring by the IT company specialists.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Focus on Core Activities Working with our outsource staff allows
            business owners to focus their activities on strategic things –
            planning, research, brand building, sales and marketing, business
            processes optimization, etc. Outsourcing also enables business
            owners to plan and execute more effective projects or, vice versa,
            experiment and find new unusual solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Operational Costs Control We are responsible for keeping control
            over the time & budget of the project (especially if it is
            project-based cooperation).
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Continuity and Risk Management NTP ensures a level of continuity
            for the customers to reduce the risk of employee turnover. Also, one
            important factor in any business is risk assessment and analysis. IT
            experts will plan and mitigate potential risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            8. Project Management Simplification The success of the project
            depends a lot on the quality of project management and on how well
            business owners can organize the cooperation of the team.
            Outsourcing on a project-based model already includes project
            management.
          </p>
          <p>
            9. Work Relationships Simplification Working with NTP is based on
            and regulated by an official agreement signed which makes the whole
            cooperation simpler and less risky.
