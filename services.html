          <h2>IT Audit</h2>
          <p>
            <span> When was your last company check-up? </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Businesses are relying on their IT department now more than ever.
            Supporting and maintaining a functional and secure IT environment
            was already taking up the time of IT departments across the world
            before a wave of new devices, operating systems and a whole lot of
            new issues entered the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a stable and efficient network is very important for business
            nowadays. That’s a well-known fact. But supporting and maintaining
            such a network is very often difficult. If network problems occur,
            fast and efficient reaction is crucial. Business owners and managers
            know that they can get better productivity from their staff if their
            IT is designed to deliver productivity and more importantly minimise
            downtime. Many may not even know there is a better way. This is
            where IT auditing comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Why Is IT Auditing Necessary?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            IT auditing is primarily of several types – performance, compliance
            to applicable laws, standards and policies, and financial statement
            audits. The main objective of the audits is to see whether there are
            any inaccuracies and inefficiencies in the management and use of the
            IT system of a business. This system first identifies the risks in
            an entity and then assesses them with the help of advanced design
            controls, therefore allowing the companies to think of an
            appropriate solution to tackle the threats. Thus, IT auditing is
            critical for companies and businesses looking to protect their IT
            systems and valuable data and information.
          </p>

          <p><span>What is involved in an IT audit?</span></p>
          <p>
            IT auditing is undertaken for a number of reasons, often relating to
            performance, compliance, cost and security. During the auditing
            process, an IT specialist will assess a company’s infrastructure,
            policies and information. There are generally a number of different
            steps that will often vary depending on the nature and the needs of
            the business. Some of these include:
          </p>

          <p>
            As businesses rely on information technologies and IT consulting to
            keep pace with today’s fast-moving IT landscape. Failing to react
            quickly and accurately, you risk being outpaced by your competitors
            who are using technology to their advantage! Successful
            organizations look ahead, identify where they need to be, and map
            out the technology that will get them there. For many organizations,
            IT consultants are a big part of that roadmap.

          <p><span>Benefits of IT Consultant Services</span></p>
          <p>
            IT consultants give you access to a wealth of specialized talent,
            proven best practices, and winning processes, all based on thousands
            of hours of experience with many customers. The benefits of an IT
            consultant can include:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Expertise: </span> In many small and mid-sized companies,
            in-house IT staff are generalists. With an external IT consultant,
            however, you can gain specialized skills, in-depth knowledge of
            current solutions, and the tools and capabilities your organization
            requires.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Faster project completion: </span> Many consultants engage
            quickly and require minimal time to get up to speed. They also work
            quickly, as they bring the right experience and tools to every
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Potential cost savings: </span> An IT specialist can often
            complete technology projects using fewer resources than your
            in-house might need. The consultant will give you an accurate
            upfront estimate regarding the cost of the engagement, and once the
            project is complete, you won’t need to keep the specialist on the
            payroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Skills transfer: </span> A consultant can share expertise and
            provide training throughout the engagement, resulting in a stronger
            in-house team overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Reduced security risk: </span> IT consultants can identify and
            resolve security threats in your network and systems. They work with
            your team to establish processes and protocols to ensure better
            ongoing protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Increased productivity: </span> In-house IT teams, especially
            in smaller companies, are often overwhelmed with multiple projects
            and conflicting priorities. Engaging an IT consultant to complete
            specific projects can free up your team to focus on core business
            functions and priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Improved processes: </span> IT consultants deliver more than
            just technical expertise. They also use proven, repeatable processes
            that they pass on to your team through documented IT playbooks and
            technology training.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> An objective view: </span>Armed with experience and a toolkit
            of best practices, IT consultants bring a fresh perspective to your
            technology environment. They identify issues you may have overlooked
            and make recommendations about improving or replacing legacy
            technology systems and practices.

          <p>
            Assistance with strategic IT planning is one of most frequently
            requested services. We think of strategic IT as a core competitive
            strength, helping you to invest in the right technologies to prepare
            your company today for tomorrow’s challenges. NTP IT consultants
            will work with you to document a detailed strategic plan that maps
            your business goals to short-term and long-term action plans to
            achieve those goals.
          </p>
          <p><span> IT Budgeting </span></p>
          <p>
            IT budgeting goes hand in hand with strategic IT planning. But
            trying to build a technology budget without a clear understanding of
            what your company needs is frustrating. NTP IT consultants work with
            you to develop a realistic IT budget that incorporates both your own
            assets and resources, plus the projected costs of the new technology
            that will deliver the most value to your organization and help you
            reach your business goals.
          </p>
          <p><span>IT Assessments</span></p>
          <p>
            Chances are your network has developed gradually over time, with
            layers of hardware and software that may now be contributing to
            unintended security gaps or inefficiencies. NTP IT consultants can
            conduct a comprehensive review of your IT environment and examine
            how your current technology is helping or hindering your business.
            You receive a written evaluation of the key areas that need
            improvement, with prioritized recommendations.
          </p>
          <p><span> Security Risk Assessments </span></p>
          <p>
            As your business relies more heavily on technology, the inherent
            risks increase as well. A single data breach or ransomware attack
            can cause huge financial, legal and reputational damage. Our
            comprehensive cybersecurity assessment identifies your level of risk
            and defines a mitigation approach to minimize and manage your
            threats and vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p><span> Cloud & Data Migration Services </span></p>
          <p>
            Many businesses are transferring their data and applications from
            on-premises data centers to private or public clouds, typically to
            reduce costs, increase security, and build redundancy.Our IT
            consultancy helps you develop the right cloud migration strategy,
            including having the right cloud security in place. We take you
            through the pros and cons, help you evaluate cloud providers,
            calculate costs, and then implement a plan to ensure a successful
            cloud migration project.

          <p><span> Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) </span></p>
          <p>
            Business interruptions happen, and a continuity and disaster
            recovery plan is vital to keep your company up and running through
            whatever crisis you might face. As an information technology
            consulting firm, NTP helps you formulate a BC/DR plan that
            encompasses how employees communicate in a crisis, where they go to
            find the information they need, and how they can access the tools
            and processes they need to perform their jobs in any situation.

            your business needs strategic direction but you don’t have the
            budget for a full-time CIO, a virtual CIO is an excellent choice to
            help you set your priorities and manage your day-to-day technology
            operations. Our seasoned virtual CIOs have helped tens of other
            companies navigate the same challenges you are facing.

              Why Your Business Need Information Technology Planning Services?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most significant reason, the key point and the value
            delivered by IT planning is that you can create an IT strategic plan
            or roadmap for your organization. In general, an IT strategic plan
            lays out your key business drivers, objectives and goals, and
            identifies the actions needed to achieve them. An IT roadmap is
            crucial to ensure your technology organization is in alignment with
            the overall business strategy and objectives. Having a documented IT
            strategy benefits both technology leaders and functional executives
            by creating transparency and encouraging collaboration across teams.
          </p>

          <p>More specifically, an IT strategic roadmap can help you:</p>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Create an “end-state vision” that gives you and your team a clear
            picture of where your company is headed.
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Identify priorities in both the short term and long term, so
            everyone understands what needs to be tackled first and what can
            wait.
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Align your business plan to a realistic IT budget that enables you
            to implement the right level of innovation to meet your
            organization's needs.
          </h5>
          <h5 class="Auditspn">
            ⇨ Gain executive buy-in across all critical stakeholders, allowing
            for quicker and more efficient execution of the plan.
