        <h2>IT planning</h2>
        <p>
          Assistance with strategic IT planning is one of most frequently
          requested services. We think of strategic IT as a core competitive
          strength, helping you to invest in the right technologies to prepare
          your company today for tomorrow’s challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          NTP IT consultants will work with you to document a detailed strategic
          plan that maps your business goals to short-term and long-term action
          plans to achieve those goals.
        </p>
        <p><span> IT Budgeting </span></p>
        <p>
          IT budgeting goes hand in hand with strategic IT planning. But trying
          to build a technology budget without a clear understanding of what
          your company needs is frustrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          NTP IT consultants work with you to develop a realistic IT budget that
          incorporates both your own assets and resources, plus the projected
          costs of the new technology that will deliver the most value to your
          organization and help you reach your business goals.
        </p>
        <p><span>IT Assessments</span></p>
        <p>
          Chances are your network has developed gradually over time, with
          layers of hardware and software that may now be contributing to
          unintended security gaps or inefficiencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          NTP IT consultants can conduct a comprehensive review of your IT
          environment and examine how your current technology is helping or
          hindering your business. You receive a written evaluation of the key
          areas that need improvement, with prioritized recommendations.
        </p>
        <p><span> Security Risk Assessments </span></p>
        <p>
          As your business relies more heavily on technology, the inherent risks
          increase as well. A single data breach or ransomware attack can cause
          huge financial, legal and reputational damage. Our comprehensive
          cybersecurity assessment identifies your level of risk and defines a
          mitigation approach to minimize and manage your threats and
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p><span> Cloud & Data Migration Services </span></p>
        <p>
          Many businesses are transferring their data and applications from
          on-premises data centers to private or public clouds, typically to
          reduce costs, increase security, and build redundancy.Our IT
          consultancy helps you develop the right cloud migration strategy,
          including having the right cloud security in place. We take you
          through the pros and cons, help you evaluate cloud providers,
          calculate costs, and then implement a plan to ensure a successful
          cloud migration project.
        </p>
        <p><span> Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) </span></p>
        <p>
          Business interruptions happen, and a continuity and disaster recovery
          plan is vital to keep your company up and running through whatever
          crisis you might face.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an information technology consulting firm, NTP helps you formulate
          a BC/DR plan that encompasses how employees communicate in a crisis,
          where they go to find the information they need, and how they can
          access the tools and processes they need to perform their jobs in any
          situation.
        </p>
        <p><span>Virtual CIO (vCIO)</span></p>
        <p>
          A virtual CIO is a semi-dedicated IT executive who provides short- or
          long-term support for IT strategy, operations, and leadership. If your
          business needs strategic direction but you don’t have the budget for a
          full-time CIO, a virtual CIO is an excellent choice to help you set
          your priorities and manage your day-to-day technology operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our seasoned virtual CIOs have helped tens of other companies navigate
          the same challenges you are facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Why Your Business Need Information Technology Planning Services?
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most significant reason, the key point and the value
          delivered by IT planning is that you can create an IT strategic plan
          or roadmap for your organization. In general, an IT strategic plan
          lays out your key business drivers, objectives and goals, and
          identifies the actions needed to achieve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          An IT roadmap is crucial to ensure your technology organization is in
          alignment with the overall business strategy and objectives. Having a
          documented IT strategy benefits both technology leaders and functional
          executives by creating transparency and encouraging collaboration
          across teams.
        </p>

        <p>More specifically, an IT strategic roadmap can help you:</p>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Create an “end-state vision” that gives you and your team a clear
          picture of where your company is headed.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Identify priorities in both the short term and long term, so
          everyone understands what needs to be tackled first and what can wait.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Align your business plan to a realistic IT budget that enables you
          to implement the right level of innovation to meet your organization's
          needs.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Gain executive buy-in across all critical stakeholders, allowing for
          quicker and more efficient execution of the plan.
